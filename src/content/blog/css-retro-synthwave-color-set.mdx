so i am listening to a lot of synthwave music streams while coding, and i am just fascinated with the artwork for most of those videos. i realized that this blog already has some known color schemes which i can work with and expand this a little bit more. let's see how much retro i can get into this thing. here are my colors so far for the first set:

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b
```
